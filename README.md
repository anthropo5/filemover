# filecopier
Application moves files from main-folder to sub-folder depending on file extension.
You have to define main-folder, sub-folders and extensions in "config.txt".
Personally I use it to segregating files in download folder.

## config.txt
In first line you have to specify folder where application will be working i.e. 
main folder: F:/Path/to/folder/download

In next lines you have to specify folder name and extensions of files which be moved to it i.e. 
folder_name: ext1 ext2 ext3 
images: jpeg jpg png tiff giff

"config.txt" contains simple example. You can use it.

## _testfolder
Contains empty files with diffren extensions. Allows you to test aplication. Remember have to specify path in config.txt
